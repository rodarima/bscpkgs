\section{Nbody}
The nbody program has been executed with varying block sizes while the execution 
time $t$ is measured, as shown in the figure \ref{fig:nbody.test}.

\end{figure}

The normalized time $\hat t$ is computed with the median time $t_m$ using $ \hat 
t = t / t_{m} - 1 $. It can be observed that the normalized times exceed the 
maximum allowed interval in most cases, except with the largest block sizes.

Once the experiment \texttt{exp.nbody.test} changes, the hash of the experiment 
program will change, therefore the plot will be updated and, lastly, this 
report.
