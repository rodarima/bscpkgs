Git message guidelines
----------------------

  1. Don't use uppercase in the beggining of your subject line (the
     first line of the commit message)

  2. Prepend the subsystem, package or the app to your subject in
     lowercase separated by a colon (example "nbody: simplify the
     granularity experiment")

  3. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (use "add X", not
     "added X" nor "adding X"). A properly formed Git commit subject
     line (without the prefix) should always be able to complete the
     following sentence:

       "If applied, this commit will <your subject here>"

  4. Limit the subject line to 50 characters and keep it simple

  5. Separate subject from body with a blank line

  6. Do not end the subject line with a period

  7. Wrap the body at 72 characters

  8. Use the body to explain the details
